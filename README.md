Simple Keylogger

This project is a basic Python keylogger that records all keyboard input and saves it to a text file. It captures every key pressed and logs it for review. The program runs silently in the background and displays typed characters in the console as well.

Key features include.
• Captures all keystrokes including letters, numbers, spaces, tabs, and special keys.
• Logs keystrokes to a text file for later analysis.
• Displays typed keys live in the console window.

This tool is designed to help users understand keyboard input capture and is intended for educational purposes only.

Ethical Use Notice:
This keylogger is created solely for learning and research. It should only be used on computers where you have explicit permission. Unauthorized use to record others’ keystrokes is illegal and unethical.
